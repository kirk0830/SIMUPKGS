*** UPDATE ***  
Although bugs are fixed, and main functions of gro_conne_gen.py have been completed, I plan to build topology file output function in standard format.  
So there are still things to do and, it will be accomplished some..day (lol)

p.s.: recently I am learning how to write diagonalization and fft algorithm. For solving Hartree fock equation or upcoming Kohn-sham equation, they are, of necessity.  
Then I will turn to study how to write optimizer although I had written some of them quite primarily.  
See you!
